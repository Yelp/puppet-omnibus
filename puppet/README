Puppet FPM recipe

This was prepared inside vagrant precise instance, i will add more details as
i go and stumble upon non-obvious things.

Make sure you do

    $ PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/puppet-omnibus/embedded/lib/pkgconfig \
      bundle package

every time you change gems/versions. You will need to apt-get install
libvirt-dev to make installing ruby-libvirt happy.
